The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if the calculation results in a value that is not a valid CSS unit (such as a negative value for properties that don't accept negative values like width or height) or involves invalid operands, it can lead to unexpected results or errors.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 200px);` might work fine if the containing element is wider than 200px, but if it is narrower, the `width` will become negative, causing the element to disappear or behave unexpectedly. Another example:  `margin: calc(10px + string);` will fail because 'string' is not a number.
